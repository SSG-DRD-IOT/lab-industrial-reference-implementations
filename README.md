# Industrial IoT Reference Implementations

Intel engineers have created a number of reference implementations that show case specific use cases in the industrial space. 


Follow the link below to find a listing of these reference implementations and take some time to deploy the ones that best fit your interests both locally on your laptops as well as remotely on the Up2 Board. 

If you need a refresher on how to deploy remotely using Intel System Studio Please refer to this lab: [Running Object Flaw Detector](https://github.com/SSG-DRD-IOT/object-flaw-detector-up2-lab)
